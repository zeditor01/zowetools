# zowetools

This github repository contains worked examples of deploying zowe, and tools that plugin to zowe.

Zowe is am opensource framework for z/OS that offers multiple enhancements, that provides a modern, productive alternative to traditional 3270 terminal interfaces.
ZOWE consists of
* A web-based user interface (Zowe App Framework)
* Command-line interface (Zowe CLI)
* REST APIs (API Mediation Layer)

Zowe is highly extensible. Users and vendors can develop plugins, extensions, and applications to enhance its functionality. This allows for customization and integration with existing tools and workflows.

It provides a bridge between traditional z/OS environments and contemporary development approaches, enabling organizations to leverage their mainframe investments more effectively while adapting to changing technology landscapes.

The home of the zowe website, with documentation and downloads is at [www.zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/)
