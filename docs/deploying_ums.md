# Deploying UMS

This document is an audit trail of deploying UMS V1.2

Unified Management Server is a ZOWE plugin that provides a foundation for multiple DB2 and IMS tools. You must install UMS before you can install Db2 Administration Foundation and other experiences.

UMS provides common services that are used by other tools, such as
* Credential management by UMS JWT tokens
* Credential management by Zowe JWT tokens (to support MFA)
* JDBC connections by a DBA userid to IMS and DB2 subsystems
* Catalog Navigation Services to IMS and DB2 subsystems
* etc...
